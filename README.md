# How to run

You will need 2 prerequisite for this to be able to run
**VM*" and **Vagrant**

After you installed it you will need to open dialogue box of VM (in my case VirtualBox from Oracle).
Once you did that open up powershell and change directory to where you cloned the project and type
`vagrant up`

After everything is finished you just need to type `vagrant ssh`

Creds for db are 
User: root
Pass: root
